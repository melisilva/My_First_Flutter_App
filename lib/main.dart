//Default, in Dart each file is its mini library and the things defined in a file are only used in the file
//They can be used in other files however, unless they have a '_' before their name, if so then they are private classes and can only be used in the file in which they are defined

//void main() => runApp(MyApp()); Dart uses => when there's only one expression
void main(){
  //Put here the code that kicks off the app because this will always be the first function to be executed
  //On the screen we see a bunch of widgets
  runApp(MyApp()); //normal function written by the flutter team
  //Takes our widget tree and tries to make it a reality

}

//Widget is a special type of object
//Gonna create a class that will be the widget that we see in the app
//We can only extend one class at a time
//StatelessWidget is a class that allows us to create our own widgets
//StatelessWidget as the name suggests can't have states
//Why is there widgets that don't have state? They are widgets that are only concerned with outputing data, like Text: it only shows writing and clicking on it doesn't do anything
