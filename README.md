# My First Flutter App

This project was made in order to get comfortable with both Flutter and Dart.

The app is essentially a friendship test with various questions and each answer has a different score attributed to them. Depending on the score obtained by a person, a different message will pop up.

Made with the guidance of the following youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0uinJvhNxI
